# Forkify--Model-View-Controller- (Work in progress!)
Pulls recipes from an api and displays them to the user.

BUG: Event.preventDefault is not working despite it being present in the code. It works in development but somehow when deployed doesn't.

Half-way solution: The bug is created when use CI/CD but when I manually deploy the site it works as expected. Has something to do with parcel.
